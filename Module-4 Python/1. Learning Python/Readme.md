## Introduction

This repository serves as a reference for beginners learning Python. It covers fundamental concepts and provides code examples to illustrate each concept.

## Valid and Invalid Identifiers

Python identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, etc. This section explains valid and invalid identifier naming conventions in Python.

## Data Types

Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, booleans, strings, complex numbers, and lists. This section introduces these data types.

## Python Operators

Python provides a wide range of operators, such as arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators. This section explains how to use these operators.

## Input

Learn how to take user input in Python using the `input()` function.

## Type Conversion

Understand how to convert data between different types in Python.

## If-Else Statements

Explore conditional statements in Python using if-else constructs.

## Loops

Learn about for loops and while loops, and how to use them for iteration.

## String Manipulation

Discover various string operations, including string slicing, concatenation, and common string methods.

## Lists

Understand lists, a versatile data structure in Python, and how to work with them.

## Tuples

Explore tuples, which are similar to lists but immutable.

## Sets

Learn about sets and their operations.

## Dictionaries

Understand how dictionaries work and their methods for key-value data storage.

## Functions

Define and use functions in Python to organize and reuse code.

## File Handling

Read and write files in Python, with examples of reading and writing text files.
