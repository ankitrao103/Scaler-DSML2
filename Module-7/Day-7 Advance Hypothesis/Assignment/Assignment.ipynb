    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- A) A coffee shop considering two different promotional strategies (Strategy A and Strategy B) to boost sales during the morning hours is a scenario suitable for A/B testing. In A/B testing, the coffee shop can randomly assign customers to either Strategy A or Strategy B and measure the impact on sales. This helps in determining which strategy leads to a higher increase in sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- B) A university conducting a survey to assess the effectiveness of two teaching methods (Method A and Method B) in improving student performance in mathematics is also suitable for A/B testing. The university can randomly assign students to either Method A or Method B, assess their performance, and determine if one teaching method is more successful than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C) The scenario with the nutritionist comparing average weight loss among three different diet plans involves more than two groups (Low-Carb, Mediterranean, and Vegan). While it is a suitable scenario for ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), A/B testing is typically designed for comparing two variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- D) The manufacturing company studying the effects of two factors (Temperature and Humidity) on material strength involves more than two variations (different combinations of temperature and humidity). Similar to option C, this scenario is better suited for ANOVA or factorial experiments, as it involves more than two variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **In A/B testing, the focus is on comparing two variations to determine which one performs better in achieving a specific goal or outcome.**"
